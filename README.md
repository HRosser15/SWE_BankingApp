## Stuff to do

1. download git with link below

2. familiarize yourself with basic git commands (add, commit, push, pull, branch, checkout)
There are a bunch of youtube videos that go over the basics, I recommend finding a current one (after Mar 15 22) as the video i watched was made before March 15 2022 and some of it didn't apply anymore. 

## Our biggest priority right now is essentially getting a baby version of the app we have been making docs for. We just need an app that has a GUI with buttons and text boxes that do what we said they would.

## We should try to implement the security measures and the database as well, but since we are running so low on time, these will be things we can take care of when we have finished the basics and have extra time to figure these parts out. If anyone here has experience with making a database work with an application, we may be able to start working on it now, I'll leave that up to you. 

3. We need to write the code, which I think we all pretty much already have a basic version of, though we will need to alter it to match the mobile app GUI as well as creating a username and password etc. Keep in mind this code will be used with the GUI as well.

4. We need to get the GUI made (buttons, text boxes, different screens, etc).

5. Once that is all set, we can combine the GUI with the code and start making adjustments as needed for anything that doesn't work properly. 

6. Determine which programs we will use to auto-test the application

7. Perform Tests
