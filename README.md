## Stuff to do - in order of priority

1. download git with link below

2. familiarize yourself with basic git commands (add, commit, push, pull, branch, checkout)
There are a bunch of youtube videos that go over the basics, I recommend finding a current one as the video i watched was made before March 15 2022 and some of it didn't apply anymore. 

3. We need to write the code. (We also need to figure out how to connect it to a database, though I doubt our professor will dock points if we don't)

4. We need to get the GUI set up.

5. Get the code working with the GUI

6. Determine which programs we will use to test the application

7. Perform Tests
